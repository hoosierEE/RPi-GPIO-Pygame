# RPi GPIO Slideshow

I had no luck finding a minimal example of using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins and Pygame together, so after some trial and error, I ended up with this.

All in one file with global variables galore and a total lack of OOP or functional programming.  But, hopefully it is easy to follow the logic and extract the important bits for other projects.

One caveat: the hard-coded array of image path strings should be modified to point to your own directory full of images.
