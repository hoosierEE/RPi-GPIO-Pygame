# RPi GPIO Slideshow

> Tested with Python 2.7

I was unable to find a working, minimal example of using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins and Pygame together, so after some trial and error, I ended up with this.

All of the code is contained in a single file.  It uses stateful global variables all over the place and has hard-coded everything.  BUT!  This is not about code style, it's about providing an easy-to-understand, small, complete example.
